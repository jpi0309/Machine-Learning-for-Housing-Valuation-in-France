Machine Learning for Housing Valuation in France

⏳ **Project Status: In Progress**

**data_preparation1.ipynb**

Exploratory analysis of the overall condition and structure of the DVF dataset, focusing on real estate transaction data quality, completeness, and basic statistical properties.

**data_preparation2.ipynb**

Enhances the original dataset by engineering additional features, including population density, environmental interaction variables (e.g., distance to the nearest hospital, number of shops within a specified radius), and distance to the coastline.

**data_preparation3.ipynb**

Focused on univariate and multivariate analysis of the enriched dataset to better understand variable distributions and relationships. (In progress)

## 🗂️ Data Sources

| Name | Source | Description | Link |
|:------|:--------|:-------------|:------|
| **Requests for Land Values (DVF)** | Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry | This dataset, "Requests for Land Values," published and produced by the Directorate General of Public Finances, provides information on real estate transactions that took place over the last five years in metropolitan France and the French overseas departments and territories (except Alsace, Moselle, and Mayotte). The data comes from notarial deeds and cadastral information. Data covers the period 2020-2025. | [data.gouv.fr - DVF](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres) |
| **National Building Database**|Scientific and Technical Center for Building|The BDNB (National Building Database) is a map of the existing building stock. Structured at the "building" level, it contains an identity card for each of the 32 million buildings , both residential and commercial. It is built by geospatial cross-referencing of approximately twenty databases from public organizations.|[adresse.data.gouv.fr – Base Adresse Nationale](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/base-de-donnees-nationale-des-batiments) |
| **National Register of Co-ownership Properties**| National Housing Agency  | The register aims to list co-owned residential properties. It allows for online registration and updating of a co-owned property's data by its legal representative or a notary, and provides access to a directory and statistical data. The data collected contributes to public policies concerning co-owned properties. |[Registre national d’immatriculation des copropriétés (RNIC)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/registre-national-dimmatriculation-des-coproprietes)|

| **France Geolocated DVF Land Values** | kaggle | This dataset is derived from the Land valuation requests dataset distributed by the DGFiP. It offers an alternative, standardized and enriched format covering the years 2014–2020. | [Kaggle – France Geolocated DVF Land Values](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muralimopidevi/france-geolocated-dvf-land-values) |
